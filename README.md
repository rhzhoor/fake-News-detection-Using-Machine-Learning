# fake-News-detection-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on the automatic identification of fake content in news articles using various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. The accuracy of these algorithms will be compared to determine the most effective approach for identifying fake news. To validate the results, two different datasets from Kaggle were used, which can be accessed through the provided link. By applying machine learning techniques to detect fake news, this project aims to contribute to the ongoing effort to combat the spread of false information and promote the accuracy of news reporting
